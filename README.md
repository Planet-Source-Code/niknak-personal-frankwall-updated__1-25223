So download the code, comment on the code and then rate the code.
 
### More Info
 
It has one little problem, when you right click on the head the menu can corrupt the form, it doesnt seem to redraw itself, and the me.refresh function didnt have any effect, easy solution, drag it off the screen and on again to force a redraw.
